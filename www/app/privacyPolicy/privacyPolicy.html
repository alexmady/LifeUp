<p>CREATIVEGOOD SOLUTIONS LTD (“We”) are committed to protecting and
    respecting your privacy.</p>

<p>
</p>

<p>
    This is our privacy policy. It explains what information we collect, how
    and when we use it, how and when we share it, where we store it and the
    security practices we use to look after it. </p>

<p>
</p>

<p>
    CREATIVEGOOD SOLUTIONS LTD provides a personal development application
    called LifeUp. LifeUp consists of a course designed to help you become more
    mindful. As part of its service, CREATIVEGOOD SOLUTIONS LTD collects
    information, including your registration details and information about your
    performance. By registering for and downloading LifeUp, you acknowledge that
    you have read and understood this document and agree to the information
    practices described below.</p>

<p>
</p>

<p>
    For the purpose of the Data Protection Act 1998 (the Act), the data
    controller is CREATIVEGOOD SOLUTIONS LTD of 27 Durnsford Avenue, London, SW19
    8BH.</p>

<p></p>

<p><b>Collection  Of Information </b></p>

<p></p>

<p>
    CREATIVEGOOD SOLUTIONS LTD collects two types of information: Personal
    information, which means information that can be used to uniquely identify and
    contact you; and non-personal information, which does not provide direct
    association with you.</p>

<p>
</p>

<p>
    When you register to use LifeUp, we collect the following:</p>

<p>
    <br>
    - Your sign-in data (which includes: your name and either email address or
    Facebook login information), which we use to identify you so you have exclusive
    access to your account. You can sign in to LifeUp using your Facebook account;
    in this case, your sign-in is also governed by and subject to Facebook’s
    privacy policy.</p>

<p>
    <br>
    - Your demographic information, which we use for our research and to show you
    how well you are performing compared to the rest of your demographic. Your
    demographic information is non-personal.</p>

<p>
    <br>
    - Your answers to our motivations questionnaire, which will allow us to create
    a customised training plan for you. Your answers to our motivations
    questionnaire are non-personal.</p>

<p>
    <br>
    - Device information. We may collect information about the device or any
    computer you may use to download or stream a copy of the LifeUp application on
    your device, including, where available, the device’s or computer’s unique
    device identifiers, operating system, browser type and mobile network
    information as well as the device’s telephone number, for system administration
    and to report aggregate information to our advertisers. We may associate device
    information with your sign-in data and will treat the combined information as
    personal data in accordance with this policy for as long as it is combined.</p>

<p>
    <br>
    - Log information. When you use LifeUp, we may automatically collect and store
    certain information in server logs, including but not limited to internet
    protocol (IP) addresses, internet service provider (ISP), clickstream data,
    browser type and language, viewed and exit pages and date or time stamps.</p>

<p>
</p>

<p>
    If you contact us for customer service, we may also collect any
    information you give us. We use this information to identify you as a customer
    and help improve our service.</p>

<p>
</p>

<p>
    When you use LifeUp, we collect non-personal information on your usage
    and performance. We use this information to calculate your performance, to
    provide you with personalised feedback to tell you where you are improving and
    how quickly, and to construct your training plan (consisting of the goals and
    games you are served). We also use this information to help us improve the app
    for future updates.</p>

<p>
</p>

<p><strong>Disclosing Information</strong></p>

<p>
</p>

<p>
    We will not sell, rent or give any of your personal information to third
    parties, with the following exceptions:</p>

<p>
    <br>
    - If we need to in order to provide a product or service you have requested.<br>
    - If you have explicitly given us permission to do so.</p>

<p>
    And except from the following legal circumstances:<br>
    - If we are responding to a subpoena, court order, or legal process, or to
    establish or exercise our legal rights or to defend ourselves against legal
    claims.<br>
    - If we have to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take
    action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving
    potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of our Terms
    of Service, or as otherwise required by law.<br>
    - If we are acquired by or merged with another company. (In this case, we will
    notify you before any information is shared and becomes subject to a different
    privacy policy.)</p>

<p></p>

<p><strong>Storage And Retention Of Information</strong></p>

<p></p>

<p>
    We store your personal information on a secure server complying to all
    EU regulations.</p>

<p>
    The information that we collect from you may be transferred to, and
    stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area (EEA). It may also
    be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for us or for one of
    our suppliers. These staff may be engaged in the fulfilment of your request,
    order or reservation, the processing of your payment details and the provision
    of support services. By submitting your personal data, you agree to this
    transfer, storing or processing. &nbsp;We will take all steps reasonably
    necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with
    this privacy policy.</p>

<p>
</p>

<p>
    Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password that
    enables you to access certain parts of the LifeUp application, you are
    responsible for keeping this password confidential. Please don’t share a
    password with anyone.</p>

<p>
    We will only store your information as long as is necessary for us to
    make LifeUp available to you. This means that if you choose to remove LifeUp from
    your phone and delete your account, we will delete all your personal
    information.</p>

<p>
</p>

<p><strong>Security</strong></p>

<p></p>

<p>
    We take reasonable measures to protect your personal information against
    loss; theft; unauthorised access, collection and disclosure; and improper use
    or modification.</p>

<p>
    Your personal information is password-protected and can only be seen by
    you and us. You acknowledge that if you disclose your password to anyone else,
    we cannot be held responsible for any misuse of your data.</p>

<p>
    No security system is perfectly effective. And since the Internet is a
    global environment, using the Internet to collect and process information
    necessarily involves the transmission of data on an international basis.
    Therefore you acknowledge that we are not responsible for any misuse of your
    data that may occur from malicious attacks from third parties, unless it can be
    shown that we have failed to follow reasonable security precautions.</p>

<p></p>

<p><strong>Your Rights</strong></p>

<p></p>

<p>
    You have the right to ask us not to process your personal data for
    marketing purposes. We will usually inform you (before collecting your data) if
    we intend to use your data for such purposes or if we intend to disclose your
    information to any third party for such purposes. You can exercise your right
    to prevent such processing by checking certain boxes on the forms we use to
    collect your data. You can also exercise the right at any time by contacting us
    at CREATIVEGOOD SOLUTIONS LTD of 27 Durnsford Avenue, London, SW19 8BH.</p>

    of our partner networks, advertisers and affiliates (including, but not limited
    to, websites on which the LifeUp application or the services we provide are
    advertised). If you follow a link to any of these websites, please note that
    these websites and any services that may be accessible through them have their
    own privacy policies and that we do not accept any responsibility or liability
    for these policies or for any personal data that may be collected through these
    websites or services, such as contact and location data. Please check these
    policies before you submit any personal data to these websites or use these
    services.</p>

    Any changes we may make to our privacy policy in the future will be
    posted on this page and, where appropriate, notified to you by such means as we
    consider appropriate. The new terms may be displayed on-screen and you may be
    required to read and accept them to continue your use of the LifeUp application
