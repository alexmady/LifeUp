            "Life moves pretty fast. If you don't stop and look around once in a while, you could miss it."

            <p> Your overall quality of life is guided by how you feel in yourself, and how you feel about your life
                situation, moment by moment.</p>

            <p>Your entire life is just a series of moments, If your mind is preoccupied with thoughts about the future
                or the past, you are missing the here and now. When we live life through this distracted interpretation
                of reality, our experience is dulled and you can miss the aliveness of the moment and the fullness of
                life.</p>

            <p>Your ability to go about your day to day life but remain connected with your 'joie de vivre' depends on
                how you manage the relationship between your mind, body and your attention.</p>

            <p>LifeUp helps you maximise your experience of life by providing the education and tools of mind, body and
                attention management.</p>

            <strong>The LifeUp approach is based on the following key truisms of interaction between mind, body and
                attention.</strong>

            <p>
            <ol>
                <li type="disc"> The secret to feeling a deep connection and satisfaction with life is to meet it where
                    it resides, in the moment
                    (not the past or future). This is achieved by managing your mind's disposition to sit in the middle
                    of you and
                    life; to experience life directly rather than as a second hand story as told by your mind
                </li>

                <br>

                <li type="disc">You can't control what your mind thinks but you can identify unhelpful thoughts and
                    choose whether to take them
                    personally or not
                </li>

                <br>
                <li type="disc">Unhelpful emotions are caused by taking unhelpful thoughts personally. You can release
                    an unhelpful emotion by
                    paying attention to the sensation the emotion creates in the body
                </li>

                <br>

                <li type="disc">The trick to changing how you feel, is to first accept how you feel and then to
                    de-personalise the unhelpful
                    thoughts driving the feelings.
